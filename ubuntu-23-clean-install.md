# Clean Install -- Ubuntu 23

## 0. If the PC is running Windows, go to `Control Panel\Hardware and Sound\Power Options\System Settings`, and under "Shutdown settings", uncheck "Turn on fast startup (recommended)" in order to disable fast startup. It's also mandatory to disable "Secure Boot" and recommended to disable "Fast Boot" in BIOS.

## 0.1 To be able to boot successfully from USB on my laptop, the trick is to simultaneouly insert the USB flash drive and press F9, right before the screen first lights up after restart, or else the device won't appear on the boot list. (I also find it best to remove any other USB devices connected to the laptop.)

Flashing a Linux image typically involves creating a bootable USB drive or SD card with the Linux distribution's installation files. Once the image is flashed onto the drive, it becomes formatted in a filesystem format that may not be natively supported by Windows or macOS.

Windows typically uses NTFS or FAT32 filesystems, while macOS uses HFS+ or APFS. Linux distributions often use filesystems like ext4.

Here's how to fix this: <https://blog.balena.io/did-etcher-break-my-usb-sd-card/>

## 1. Check for Updates (`apt` stands for Aptitude. In truth, `apt` doesn't need to be preceeded by `sudo` as it automatically performs operations with superuser privileges when necessary, but it's still standard to type it, to guarantee that the commands run successfully in all situations.)

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade
```

## **Restart the computer for changes to apply: `sudo reboot now`**

## 2. Enable additional repositories for more software

Using the Super Key to open the Activities overview and search for "Software & Updates".

Under "Ubuntu Software", check if enabled: "Main", "Universe", "Restricted" and "Multiverse" repositories.

Under "Updates", set "When there are other updates" to "Display immediately".

Under "Additional Drivers", check if updates are available.

## 3. Update Firmware via the Firmware Updater app

## **Restart the computer for changes to apply: `sudo reboot now`**

## 4. Change Dock settings

```bash
# Enable minimize when clicking on dock icons, and preview the opened windows of the same app when hovering over the icon
gsettings set org.gnome.shell.extensions.dash-to-dock click-action 'minimize-or-previews'

# Disable panel mode, making the dock float instead
gsettings set org.gnome.shell.extensions.dash-to-dock extend-height false

# Dock on the bottom of the screen
gsettings set org.gnome.shell.extensions.dash-to-dock dock-position BOTTOM

# Auto-hide the Dock
gsettings set org.gnome.shell.extensions.dash-to-dock autohide true
```

## 5. Change Mouse and Touchpad settings

Under "Mouse & Touchpad", increase "Pointer Speed" and enable "Tap to Click".

```bash
gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.peripherals.mouse speed 1.0

```bash
gsettings set org.gnome.settings-daemon.plugins.power sleep-inactive-battery-type 'nothing'
```

```bash
org.gnome.settings-daemon.plugins.power power-button-action 'suspend'
```

## 7. Enable Num Lock at startup

```bash
gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.peripherals.keyboard remember-numlock-state true
```

## 8. Show Hidden Files

Under "Screen Display", enable "Night Light" and set it to "Sunset to Sunrise".

```bash
gsettings set org.gnome.settings-daemon.plugins.color night-light-enabled true
```

Under "Appearance", check if "Dark Style" is enabled.

```bash
gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.interface color-scheme 'prefer-dark'
```

## 12. Enable Enchanced Tilling

Under "Ubuntu Desktop", check if "Enchanced Tilling" is enabled.

## **Restart the computer for changes to apply: `sudo reboot now`**

## 14. Packages to install

- In recent versions of Ubuntu, the Snap package manager (snapd) is preinstalled by default -- it's the new App Center (orange icon), featuring only Debian and Snap apps from the Snapcraft store. As a rule, prefer snaps whenever available.

- For example, `sudo apt install package-name` installs the package version available in the Ubuntu repositories managed by APT (Advanced Package Tool). This version may be different from the version available as a snap package from the Snap Store, installable running the command `sudo snap install package-name`.

- To manually fetch the latest versions of installed snaps from the Snap Store and update them: `sudo snap refresh`.

## Optional packages and extras

### Flatpak (adds the Software app (white icon, a shopping bag with 3 colorful geometric shapes) to the system. The only downside is that youâ€™ll see multiple applications in Ubuntu software center. Flatpak applications are tagged with source dl.flathub.org and thus you can easily distinguish them.)

Note: Snaps are more tightly integrated with Ubuntu specifically, whereas Flatpaks are developed for several Linux distros. However, both systems utilize sandboxing to isolate applications from the rest of the system. Their self-containment means that they can run independently of the system's installed libraries, reducing dependency issues and conflicts.

```bash
# [Flatpak Setup](https://flatpak.org/setup/Ubuntu)
sudo apt install flatpak

sudo apt install gnome-software-plugin-flatpak

# adds the Flathub repository. Flathub is the best place to get Flatpak apps
flatpak remote-add --if-not-exists flathub https://dl.flathub.org/repo/flathub.flatpakrepo
```

### Enable weather forecast on calendar's sidebar (check if equivalent snap exists?)

```bash
sudo apt install gnome-weather
```

### Enable Livepatch (eliminates the need for unplanned maintenance windows for kernel vulnerabilities, by patching the Linux kernel while the system runs. Livepatch is included in Ubuntu Pro)

Under "Software & Updates", enable "Livepatch".

Check [How to enable the Livepatch client](https://ubuntu.com/security/livepatch/docs/livepatch/how-to/enable).

### Stacer -- system optimizer and application monitor

```bash

```

### Use apt-fast instead of apt (or apt-get, which is slowly becoming obsolete)

```bash
# Add the apt-fast PPA (Personal Package Archive) to the system's software sources.
# This repository provides the apt-fast package, which is a shell script wrapper for apt-get and Aptitude
# that accelerates package downloads by using multiple connections per package.
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:apt-fast/stable

# Update the package index to ensure that the latest package lists from all repositories, including the newly added PPA,
# are available for installation.
sudo apt-get update

# Install the apt-fast package from the apt-fast PPA.
sudo apt-get install apt-fast
```

### Thonny -- IDE for Python designed for beginners

```bash
# Unofficial snap
sudo snap install thonny
```

#### In Thonny, to allow the Raspberry to run

sudo usermod -a -G dialout <username>
```

```bash
sudo apt install wine
```

### QBittorrent -- open-source BitTorrent client

# If disabled, run this command
sudo ufw enable

# This app allows control over our ports.

### Prevent a Package From Being Updated in Ubuntu ([How to prevent a package from being updated in Ubuntu](https://itsfoss.com/prevent-package-update-ubuntu/))

This can be done using Aptitude or SPM:

#### Using Aptitude

```bash
# To hold a package and thus prevent apt from making changes to it
sudo apt-mark hold package_name

# To list all the packages that are held
sudo apt-mark showhold

# To remove hold on a package
sudo apt-mark unhold package_name
```

#### Using the installable Synaptic Package Manager

```bash
sudo apt install synaptic

# The rest is done via the app's GUI.
```
